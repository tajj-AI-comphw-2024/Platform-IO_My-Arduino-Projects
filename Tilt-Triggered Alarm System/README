# Tilt-Triggered Alarm System

A PlatformIO-based Arduino project that implements a tilt-activated alarm system using a tilt ball switch sensor and an active buzzer.

## Description

This project creates a simple but effective tilt detection alarm system. When the device is tilted beyond a certain threshold, it triggers an audible alarm through an active buzzer. The system is ideal for security applications or scenarios where motion/tilt detection is required.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Mega 2560 board
- Active Buzzer (connected to pin 11)
- Tilt Ball Switch Sensor (connected to pin 7)
- Appropriate power supply
- USB cable for programming

## Pin Configuration

- Digital Pin 11: Active Buzzer (Output)
- Digital Pin 7: Tilt Ball Switch (Input with internal pull-up)

## Software Requirements

- PlatformIO IDE (VS Code Extension)
- Arduino Framework

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project in VS Code with PlatformIO extension installed
3. Connect your Arduino Mega 2560 to your computer
4. Verify that the upload port in `platformio.ini` matches your board's COM port
5. Build and upload the project

## Usage

1. Power up the device
2. The system will automatically begin monitoring for tilt
3. When the device is level, the buzzer remains silent
4. When tilted, the buzzer activates
5. Serial monitoring (9600 baud) provides real-time status updates

## Serial Communication

The device communicates over serial at 9600 baud rate, providing:
- Current sensor state
- Buzzer activation status
- Signal value readings
