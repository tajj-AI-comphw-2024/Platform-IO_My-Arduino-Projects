Welcome to my Arduino project showcase! This collection features a variety of my work, from beginner to intermediate projects, that I’m excited to share with the community.

I’m passionate about learning and growing in the world of microcontrollers, embedded systems, and advanced hardware development, using Arduino as a stepping stone to master C-based programming for all things hardware at the lowest level.

I’m always open to suggestions, ideas, and improvements for both my current projects and future endeavors, so feel free to share your feedback.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work—I appreciate your support and look forward to collaborating!
